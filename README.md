Analcoin
============================


What Is Analcoin? 
----------------------------

Analcoin is a SHA256 Digital Currency, also referred to as a Cryptocurrency based on the Bitcoin Core. Digital Currencies are designed to replace the fiat (paper money) system and provide a way to securely transact units of wealth without using banks and third parties, to securely maintain a public consensue of transactions, and for allowing individuals and businesses to store their own wealth using their home computer, tablet, mobile phone and other digital devices.

Why Analcoin?
--------------------------

Analcoin is an open digital currency that allows any individual, business, company or team to accept direct payments without using third parties. Originally created as something light-hearted and for general public use, Analcoin has developed and now become a significant contender as a digital currency used by the Adult Industry.

Analcoin is a brand agnostic digital currency that can be branded for each business sector, e.g. Data ANALysts, ANALog Watches and many more with the addition of custom wallets available for various industry types.

Analcoin (v2.0) forked on 21st April 2015 was upgraded to fix a failed POS (proof of stake). 

It is the goal of the Analcoin (v2.0) developers for users to access to the Analcoin developments, technology and tools. Analcoin started as a SHA256 ASIC-friendly energy efficient mixed PoW/PoS coin with 150,000 Proof Of Work coins, and now operates as a 100% Proof Of Stake coin (8th April 2015). Analcoin provides a means of transaction in a pseudo-anonymous manner particularly for purchasing adult goods and services (within the current legal framework), indeed any goods and service by businesses that accept Analcoin.

Giving And Recieving Anal
----------------------------

Analcoin (v2.0) alows direct end to end transactions referred to as "giving anal" and "receiving anal". This is what is termed as a "viral component" that should allow Analcoin to target niche markets and provide a fun aspect to using and storing personal wealth (users must be age 16+).

Future Developments
----------------------------

Analcoin has already had Multisend implemented into it's latest wallet (v2.0). We also have a variety of Mac Wallets and a Raspberry Pi wallet launching following the v2.0 hard fork of 21st April 2015. Our aim is to make available a number of viral apps (for fun and marketing), an Android and iOS app, and also implement a number of future technologies to keep Analcoin up to date and usable across the widest userbase possible.
